# Needy #
Needy lets a group of people coordinate their shopping lists for food and
miscellaneous items in one place, with multiple different means of access.

### Format ###
- Needy has multiple users for a given group, but each group using Needy
  deploys their own instance of the tool, so each user only belongs to the
  current instance.
- Needy is composed of multiple lists of needed items (a list for each
  category), and the items are viewable for all users. Items can represent
  anything, and can be added.

### Lists ###
- There are lists (groceries, toiletries, etc.) that each hold different
  sets of needed things.
- Lists can be added to or be checked off by multiple users.
- Addition to lists can be done manually or by adding a recipe (below), or
  even part of a recipe
- If there is overlap, a user can view aggregate lists:
  - An aggregate list is titled based on which lists hold items that could
    be acquired at this list's source.
  - Items that are exactly the same get stacked in an aggregate view.
